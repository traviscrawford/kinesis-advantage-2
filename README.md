Key bindings for the Kinesis Advantage2 keyboard

In general, the defaults work well. These key bindings provide a few features I find useful:

* Use `Caps Lock` as the `Escape` key, as the default escape key is unreachable without lifting your hands from the neutral position.
* Enable `vi` arrow keys system-wide, by mapping these to the alternate keypad layer.
* Enable the alternate keypad layer by holding down `Delete` with your left thumb.
